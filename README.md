# FunnyCatz

This is small instagram-like app that served me as
demonstration during my "Introduction to React" university
class talk.

As such, there is not much there, but it's a good playground
for playing with CSS and page resizing.

## Getting started

### Installation

In the root directory, run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Development server

```sh
npm run
```

### Building

```sh
npm run build
```

## Cats

OK, I admit, I stole those cats from Google Images, so if
someone is mad at me and wants me to remove its cat from
this app's cat collection, let me know ;)
